# delphi-tips

This is a bunch of Delphi language tips migrated from the DelphiDabbler.com website, plus some others.

> The main reason for this repo is to ensure the survival of the tips beyond the June 2020 closure of the old delphidabbler.com web site.

There are the following folders:

* `db`: Contains a single SQL file that provides meta data about the tips: can be used with the content of the `src` folder and some suitable CSS to generate complete tips web pages.

* `docs`: This folder contains the source code of a mini website that displays the tips that were previously on delphidabbler.com. The site is developed and deployed using Jekyll. Builds are stored in the `_site` directory. The site is published at https://delphidabbler.github.io/delphi-tips/.

* `extra`: There are two open document format documents. One contains a large number of tips downloaded from the former _Delphi Pool_ website. The second contains tips collected online by _"topellina"_. There may be some duplication of tips between the PDF files and these documents. Conversely, some tips that appear in the PDFs may have been sourced and deleted from these files.

* `tips`: Contains a PDF "print out" of each of the DelphiDabbler.com tips page.

Bear in mind that all the tips are old now. Very few of the tips in the `tips` folder and none of those in the `extra` folder have been tested. **Use with care and at your own risk!**
