	How to empty a TImage
</h1>


<p>
  The first thing that comes to your mind is probably
  <var>TImage.Picture.Free</var> but I wouldn't recommend this :-) Not only
  will this actually empty the image but also free the memory associated with

  the <var>TImage.Picture</var> object. It will no longer exist, it'll be
  gone (*puff*). The solution is more than simple:

<div class="frame">

<pre class="pas-source">Image1.Picture := <span class="pas-kwd">nil</span>;</pre>
</div>
