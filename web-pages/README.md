# Archive Tips Web Pages

The contents of this directory are an archive of the tips web pages as rendered by delphidabbler.com.

The files have simply been archived to protect them from loss.

All the local .css and .js files referenced by the pages have been added to the archive but note the **the links from the .html pages to the .js and .css files are broken**.

> It's unlikely that these pages will be re-used directly: they may be used for reference if a new tips program is ever written.
