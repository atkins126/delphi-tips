<h1>
	Install components and IDE extensions into the Delphi IDE
</h1>

<p>
  In this tip I draw together in one place information on how to install
  components into the Delphi IDE for various Win32 versions of Delphi. The notes
  also cover how to install IDE extensions or make simple units available in
  design time packages. The tip assumes you are installing source code, not
  pre-compiled units or packages.
</p>

<p>
  Before you start copy all the files needed to install the component, IDE
  extension or unit into some suitable location on your hard disk. Files should
  include <code>.pas</code> files and any associated <code>.dfm</code>,
  <code>.res</code>, <code>.dfm</code> and, for components, <code>.dcr</code>
  files.
</p>

<p>
  You then proceed differently for different versions of Delphi:
</p>

    <a href="#d2">Installation with Delphi 2</a>
  </li>
</ul>

  Installation with Delphi 2005 and later
</h3>

<p>
  To add a component or IDE extension to the IDE it must be included in a design
  package. You can either create a new design package or add the component to an
  existing one. These instructions assume you will be installing into an
  existing package. See the Delphi help for information on how to create a new
  package. If your component came with its own package, use that.
</p>

<ol class="spaced">
  <li>
    Open the required package. Select <em>File | Open</em> menu and choose a
    suitable package source file (<code>.dpk</code> extension. You may decide to
    install into the &quot;user&quot; package that is often supplied with
    Delphi.
  </li>

  <li>
    The selected package (with <code>.bpl</code> extension) will now be
    displayed in the Project Manager. If the package has not been installed yet
    right click the <code>.bpl</code> entry in the Project Manager and select
    <em>Install</em>. Dismiss any resulting message dialogue.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      Now right click the <code>.bpl</code> entry again and select <em>Add</em>.
      What happens next depends on the version of Delphi.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Delphi 2009 and earlier the &quot;Add&quot; dialogue box will be
        displayed. Click the dialogue's <em>Browse</em> button then select the
        <code>.pas</code> file(s) to be installed from the resulting file open
        dialogue. The full path to the file(s) should now be displayed in the
        &quot;Add&quot; dialogue's <em>Unit file name</em> edit box. Click
        <em>OK</em> to add the file(s) to the package.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Delphi 2010 and later a simple file dialogue box will open from
        where you can choose the required <code>.pas</code> file(s). Just press
        <em>OK</em> to add the file(s) to the package.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Back in the Project Manager, check that the <code>.pas</code> file(s) you
    added appear under the package's &quot;Contains&quot; node. Also check that
    any associated <code>.dcr</code> files also appear. If any <code>.dcr</code>
    file does not appear you need to display the package's source file and add
    the line <kbd>{$R <em>FileName</em>.dcr}</kbd> to the code between the
    package name and the <var>requires</var> section. To display the source
    right click the package name in the project manager and select <em>View
    Source</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you are installing an IDE enhancement, like a property editor, make sure
    the <code>designide</code> package is included in the package's
    <var>requires</var> section.
  </li>

  <li>
    Now right click the <code>.bpl</code> entry again and select
    <em>Compile</em>. If no errors are displayed the package has been recompiled
    correctly.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
      When adding components the package may need to be (re)installed. Right
      click the <code>.bpl</code> entry again and select <em>Install</em>. If
      all goes well a message should be displayed indicating that the component
      has been registered and it will appear in the appropriate tab of the Tool
      Palette (which will be named &quot;DelphiDabbler&quot; when installing one
      of the components from the <a href="http://delphidabbler.com/codelib">DelphiDabbler Code Library</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Should a message appear saying that the installation has failed you will
      need to un-install the package and try again. How this is done depends on
      the version of Delphi.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In Delphi 2009 and earlier select the <em>Components | Install
        Packages</em> menu option then select the required package in the
        resulting dialogue box. Press the <em>Remove</em> button followed by
        <em>OK</em>. The package will now be uninstalled.
      </li>
      <li>
        In Delphi 2010 and later the <code>.bpl</code> entry's context menu has
        an <em>Uninstall</em> option. Simply click that option to uninstall the
        package.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Close the package project using the <em>File | Close</em> menu
    item. Accept any prompts to save the package project.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you wish you can now delete the <code>.pas</code> file. Other files
    must be left in place.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>
  Building for 64 bit Windows (Delphi XE2 and later)
</h4>

<p>
  If the components etc. are compatible with 64 bit Windows add to a package as
  described above. Now add a Windows 64 bit target to the package project and
  rebuild.
</p>


<h3 id="d3">
  Installation with Delphi 3 to 7
</h3>

<p>
  To add a component or IDE extenstion to the IDE it must be included in a
  design package. You can either create a new design package or add the
  component to an existing one. These instructions assume you will be
  installing into an existing package. See the Delphi help for information on
  how to create a new package. If your component came with its own package,
  use that.
</p>

<ol class="spaced">

  <li>
    Open the required package. Select <em>File | Open</em> menu, make sure
    that files with the <code>*.dpk</code> extenstion are being displayed,
    and choose a suitable package source file. You may decide to install
    into the &quot;user&quot; package. This is found in the <code>Lib</code>
    sub-directory of your Delphi installation and is named
    <code>dclusr.dpk</code> or <code>dclusrXX.dpk</code> where
    <code>XX</code> is a version number.
  </li>

  <li>
    The package editor will now be displayed. If its <em>Install</em> button
    is not disabled then click it to ensure the package is installed into
    Delphi. Dismiss any resulting message dialogue.
  </li>

  <li>
    Now click the package editor's <em>Add</em> button. The &quot;Add&quot;
    dialogue box will be displayed. Click the dialogue's <em>Browse</em> button
    then select the required <code>.pas</code> file(s) from the resulting
    file open dialogue. The full path to the file should now be displayed in
    the &quot;Add&quot; dialogue's <em>Unit file name</em> edit box. Click
    <em>OK</em> to add the file(s) to the package.
  </li>

  <li>
    Click the package editor's <em>Compile</em> button. The package will now
    be recompiled and, if no errors are displayed, the package has been
    recompiled correctly. When adding components a message may be displayed at
    this stage indicating that the component has been registered. In some cases
    it is necessary to click the <em>Install</em> button after compiling before
    the component will be registered and the message displayed. Any components
    will now appear appropriate tab of the Tool Palette (which will be named
    &quot;DelphiDabbler&quot; when installing one of the components from the
    <a href="http://delphidabbler.com/codelib">DelphiDabbler Code Library</a>).
  </li>

  <li>
    Now close the package editor window. You will probably be prompted to
    save the package. Agree to this and the package source file will be
    updated with information about the new component.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you wish you can now delete the <code>.pas</code> file. Other files
    must be left in place.
  </li>

</ol>


<h3 id="d2">
  Installation with Delphi 2
</h3>

<ol class="spaced">

  <li>
    Select the <em>Component | Install</em> menu option to display the
    &quot;Install Components&quot; dialogue box.
  </li>

  <li>
    Click the <em>Add</em> button to display the &quot;Add Module&quot;
    dialogue box.
  </li>

  <li>
    Click the <em>Browse</em> button and choose the required
    <code>.pas</code> file from the resulting standard file open dialogue box
    and click <em>Open</em>.
  </li>

  <li>
    This returns you to the &quot;Install Components&quot; dialogue box.
    Click <em>OK</em> here to rebuild the component library. If you were
    installing component it should now appear on the component palette (which
    will be named &quot;DelphiDabbler&quot; when installing one of the
    components from the
    <a href="http://delphidabbler.com/codelib">DelphiDabbler Code Library</a>).
  </li>

  <li>
    If you wish you can now delete the <code>.pas</code> file. Other files
