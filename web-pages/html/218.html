    Question 1
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    Do you know how to calculate the minimum distance between two polygons if
    they don't overlap?
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  Well, this is rather complex. I start with the basics (don't know if you
  already know). I use UPPER letters for vectors and lower letters for numbers.
  Well, and sorry that I repeat some things, I wrote the text and realized I
  forgot something you have to know for a later step, so I went back and added
  it, I didn't write this text line by line. If something isn't clear to you, I
  recommend to make some small drawings, I had to do many, too.
</p>

<p>
  A plane is defined by <code>(X - P) * N = 0</code> where <var>P</var> is a
  vector to any point in your plane and <var>N</var> is the normal vector of
  your plane. Sometimes another definition is used, which is easier to gain if
  you have the corners of a polygon: <code>X = P + a * A + b * B</code>
  (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var> are any real numbers). If you know 3 points
  <var>X1</var>, <var>X2</var>, <var>X3</var> of the plane (3 corners of the
  polygon), you can get <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> by
  <code>A = X2 - X1</code> (subtract each component of the vector from the same
  component of the other vector) and <code>B = X3 - X1</code> (and you can use
  <code>P = X1</code>).
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately this definition is not good to calculate distances, so you have
  to get <var>N</var> out of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>. <code>A * N </code>
  must be <code>0</code> and <code>B * N</code> must be <code>0</code> (which
  means <code>a1 * n1 + a2 * n2 + a3 * n3 = 0</code> and
  <code>b1 * n1 + b2 * n2 + b3 * n3 = 0</code>). Sorry I cannot remember how to
  do this, but you have 2 equations with three unknown variables, so you can
  choose one of them as you want (just be careful with <code>0</code> and not
  <code>0</code>), the only difference is that the resulting <var>N</var>
  differs in its length.
</p>

<p>
  A line is defined by <code>X = P + v * V</code> where <var>P</var> is any one
  point of your line and <var>V</var> is the line's direction (like <var>A</var>
  and <var>B</var> of the plane). Again if you know two points <var>X1</var> and
  <var>X2</var> of your line you get <var>V</var> by <code>V = X2 - X1</code>
  (and you can use <code>P = X1</code>).
</p>

<p>
  The length of a vector <code>V = (v1, v2, v3)</code> is
  <code>length = sqrt(sqr(v1) + sqr(v2) + sqr(v3))</code> (just 3-dimensional
  Pythagoras).
<p>

<p>
  You add two vectors <code>A = (a1, a2, a3)</code> and
  <code>B = (b1, b2, b3)</code> like that:
  <code>A + B = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3)</code> (which is a vector again).
</p>

<p>
  You multiply two vectors <code>A = (a1, a2, a3)</code> and
  <code>B = (b1, b2, b3)</code> like that:
  <code>A * B = (a1 * b1 + a2 *b2 + a3 * b3)</code> (which is a number).
</p>

<p>
  Use following formula to get the distance between any one point <var>X</var>
  and a plane: <code>dist = 1 / n * (X - P) * N</code> where <var>X</var> is a
  vector to the point you want to examine and <var>n</var> is the length of
  <var>N</var> (you don't need <code>1/n</code> if <var>N</var> has already
  length of <code>1</code>). If <var>X</var> is <code>(x1, x2, x3)</code> this is
</p>

<p>
  <code>dist = 1 / n * ((x1 - p1) * n1 + (x2 - p2) * n2 + (x3 - p3) * n3)<br />
  n = sqrt(sqr(n1) + sqr(n2) + sqr(n3))</code>
</p>

<p>
  Now the distance between two polygons isn't that simple, because there are
  many different cases (and a polygon is more than just a simple plane, even if
  it's size is smaller).
</p>

<p>
  What you also need is to calculate the distance between two lines. At first
  you need a plane, that is parallel to both lines and includes one of the
  lines:
</p>

<p>
  <code>P(plane) = P(line1)<br />
  A(plane) = V(line1)<br />
  B(plane) = V(line2)</code>
</p>

<p>
  where <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are two vectors in the plane
  <code>(N * A = 0 and N * B = 0)</code>, <var>V</var> is a vector in your line
  (for polygons, you can take <code>V = X2 - X1</code> where <var>X2</var> and
  <var>X1</var> are two corners). Now calculate the distance between this plane
  and any one point of <var>line2</var> using the formula above (any point
  because ALL points have the same distance to a plane that's parallel to the
  line - nice trick, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
  The last thing we need is not only the minimum distance between two lines, but
  the points of the lines, that have minimum distance. You can do this (for the
  point of <var>line1 M1</var> with minimum distance to <var>line2</var>) by
  calculating a plane again with
</p>

<p>
  <code>P(secondplane) = P(line2)<br />
  A(secondplane) = V(line2)<br />
  B(secondplane) = N(plane)</code> &lt;-- the plane we calculated above
</p>

<p>
  The second plane includes <var>line2</var> and the point of line1 with the
  minimum distance to <var>line2</var>. To get this point of minimum distance,
  set <code>P(line1) + v * V(line1) = P(secondplane) + a * A(secondplane) + b * B(secondplane)</code>. Solve this, you should get the <var>v</var> and when you set this
  <var>v</var> into <code>X = P + v * V</code> of <var>line1</var> you have the
  point <var>X</var> (=<var>M1</var>) of minimum distance.
</p>

<p>
  The bad news: To get <var>M2</var>, you have to repeat this for
  <var>line2</var>. Another way would be to take the distance between the lines
  (I call it <var>d</var>) and do following:
  <code>M2 = M1 + d * 1 / n * N(plane)</code> (or
  <code>M2 = M1 - d * 1 / n * N(plane)</code>, depends on the direction of
  <var>N</var>). The distance between two points <var>X1</var> and <var>X2</var>
  equals the length of the vector <code>X2 - X1</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, these were the basics. Now the different cases, you have to cope with:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1) The planes of both polygons are parallel
  <code>(N1 = x * N2)</code>:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Transform both polygons the following way: <code>X' = X - P</code> for each
  corner of the polygon (where <var>P</var> is any point in your plane). The new
  polygons should now be in the same plane. Test whether both polygons overlap
  (is not as simple as it sounds, to be honest I don't know how to do that).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1a) They overlap:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  The minimum distance is the distance of the two planes (take any one point of
  one plane and use the formula above to get the distance to the other plane).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1b) They do not overlap:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Use 2) to calculate the minimum distance.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2) The planes are not parallel (or case 1b):</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Calculate the minimum distance of one line of one polygon and one line of the
  other polygon. Calculate the points of minimum distance from the lines. The
  edges of the polygons do not have infinite length (the lines do have), so
  check whether the points of minimum distance are within the polygons (I'd
  better say: within the edges of the poygons).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2a) Both points are within the polygons:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Store the minimum distance from the lines.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2b) One point or both points are not within the polygon:</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Take the corner(s) of the polygon(s) within the line(s) you checked next to
  the point(s) of minimum distance. Calculate the distance between these points
  and store it. Now repeat this for each pair of lines (if you have 2 triangles
  you get 9 combinations (3 times 3). When you are ready compare all the minimum
  distances and take the smallest one.
</p>

<p>
  Okay, this is quite much to do (realtime? difficult. perhaps if you don't have
  many polygons) and there are several problems (a vector
  <code>(x1, x2, x3)</code> and a vector <code>(x1, x2, 0)</code> may have to be
  treated different, for example when you try to get <var>N</var> out of
  <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>). If you really need the minimum distance, try
  it, but perhaps you find an easier way, that is not that exact (take the
  distance between the center of each polygon would be least exact, but very
  much easier).
</p>

<p>
  I want to add, that I don't know of other solutions, perhaps there are better
  ones, and that I don't know if everything I told you is right, I haven't
  tested it, everything is just theoretically.
